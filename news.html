            <h3>Rebranding in progress...</h3>
            <p>
              A major rebranding is in progress. ‘Major’ means that I changed my
              name from ILYA to my actual name, ILLIA.
            </p>
            <p>
              It should be easy, but, in fact, it involves a great deal of work
              and consideration, as different digital distributors and platforms
              follow their own practices regarding the same music being
              resubmitted under different artist names. My music will
              temporarily disappear from most platforms and then gradually
              return as I resubmit it.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, not everything is bright. My current distributor informed
              me that some platforms (like Apple Music) might reject the
              submission. I will be in close contact with those platforms to
              prevent this. Honestly, though, I am ready for the worst (but I
              won't let it stop me).
            </p>
            <p>
              If you would like to listen to/download/buy my stuff, it is always
              available on my Bandcamp page. Really, this service should be your
              first choice when you want your favorite artist to actually feel
              that their music is being purchased. I have not been with them for
              long, but my revenue from them will soon equal my total all-time
              revenue from all the streaming platforms put together. So, yeah,
              Bandcamp rules.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m also working on new tracks, many of which are near-to-ready,
              and I will submit them too, though they will appear on Bandcamp
              long before they appear anywhere else. I just want the Spotify
              algorithms to work for me a bit.
            </p>

              That being said, there is still a 'Subscribe' button on my
              website. Feel free to click it if you want to get updates on the
              new things I do.

            <h3>Ukrainian’s jazz band mesmerized Middle Eastern audience</h3>
            <p>
              Since olden times, Ukrainians have been known for their musicality
              – and not just in terms of folk music. Ukrainians don’t sit by and
              ignore modern music. It isn’t only about winning European
              contests; our performers are well-known even in the Middle East.
            </p>
            <p>
              For instance, last week, the Illia Netkach Band achieved great
              success in the Battle of the Bands in Bahrain. “Three weeks ago, I
              received, from the organizer of the Battle of the Bands at the
              Hard Rock Cafe Bahrain, an invitation to participate. I gathered
              my colleagues and we formed a band. Before the semi-final, we had
              less than a week to rehearse. Then we had only another week to
              rehearse before the final. During the final, the judges gave us a
              standing ovation. People had a very emotional response to this
              very specific style of music,” said Mr. Illiaa, the band leader.
              Approximately 20 bands took part in the contest and six of them
              made it into the finals. “The brightest moments for us were
              on-stage performances. The audience’s response was absolutely
              unexpected. This was twice as valuable to us because we don’t have
              our own audience in Bahrain,” – that was how the musicians
              described the experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mr. Illia is a jazz violinist who composes his own music, mostly
              in the fusion style. He originally hailed from Kharkiv. In
              Ukraine, he had his own band, which performed at Fete de la
              Musique (Kharkiv). After moving to Qatar, Mr. Illia participated
              in jazz jams and recorded his own music, which he posted to
              iTunes. Later, Mr. Illia returned to Ukraine, where he stayed for
              six months and continued his musical activities. He played two
              tours as part of the Sympho Show “World Hits” and then moved to
              Bahrain. Though the band was created specifically for the contest,
              the musicians will continue collaborating. “We have plans for the
              future. At present, I have invited a few more musicians and we are
              working on a full-scale concert program. The first show is
              scheduled for after Ramadan. Our band will be international. The
              keyboardist (Alina Kharchenko) and I are from Ukraine, the
              guitarist (Sunny Salis) is from India, the bass player is from
              Pakistan and the drummer (Ryan John) is from Bahrain,” said Mr.
              Illia. The band has its own creative vision. The musicians cast
              away any comparisons and state that music is not sports. The main
              point of any contest is to perform for the audience, not to win.
              Present-day musicians often forget this. “Winning the contest was
              not our main goal. Even in the finals, we did not expect anything.
              I knew that we would win something only when the judging panel
              gave us a standing ovation. It’s still possible to read our
              communication with the organizer of the contest on the Hard Rock
              Café page. There, he said, “We’re waiting for the result,” and I
              responded that this was not the most important thing, that we had
              achieved our outcome when the last song ended. It’s not good to
              forget the real reason why music exists,” said the musician.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are quite a lot compliments about the band’s performance
              could be found online. Users emphasized the unique character of
              the music and the outstanding talent of the musicians.

              The Fête de la Musique, also known as Make Music Day or World
              Music Day, is an annual music celebration taking place on June
              21.<br />
              The concept of an all-day musical celebration on the days of the
              solstice, was originated by the French Minister of Culture, Jack
              Lang. The festival later became celebrated in 120 countries around
              the world.`
